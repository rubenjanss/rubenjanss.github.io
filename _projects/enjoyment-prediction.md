title: Enjoyment Prediction
description: Large Language Models can predict how much a user will enjoy a human-robot dialog before seeing the user's response.
---

Large Language Models (LLMs) are impressive at driving **open-domain dialogue** for social robots. We finally have an AI system that can respond to anything a user says with very natural-seeming language.

However, they're not yet perfect. Sometimes for example, LLM-driven dialogue remaines very superficial, repetitive, or the robot says something that doesn't invite any further conversation.

What if the robot could actually reason about how much the user would enjoy what it's about to say? If that were possible, we could let the robot choose from a number of possible utterances, based on what it'd think would be the most enjoyable for users. We could even use this prediction as a feedback signal for the LLM to improve itself, to become more enjoyable in human-robot dialogue.

>**We showed that LLMs can be used to do this: predicting a user's enjoyment of a robot utterance in dialogue, before the user has even reacted.**

The system we built uses GPT-4o as predictor. As you can see in the image below, we provide it one "exchange" (a user utterance and the robot's response to it), along with the history of the dialogue before the exchange. We also give it
