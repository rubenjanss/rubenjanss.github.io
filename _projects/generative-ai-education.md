title: Generative AI for Social Robots in Education
description: Generative AI models will finally enable autonomous and adaptive social robots in education>
---

The limited autonomy of social robots currently prevents many ambitions in educational robotics from being realised. This leads to scripted dialogues, content that fails to adapt to individual students and conversations remaining largely text-based. Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) might alleviate these issues, allowing for educational robots whose dialog can be flexibly generated based on the lessons to be taught, the studentâ€™s needs and personality, and the environment. This chapter presents a vision of how generative AI can power truly autonomous and adaptive social robots in education, discussing limitations of past educational robotics research, recent technical advances in AI, as well as concrete examples of applications of AI in educational human-robot interaction, and a reflection on limitations of current AI. By bridging technical and pedagogical perspectives, it shows what the next step in the evolution of human-robot interaction in educational contexts might look like.
