Hi! I'm Ruben Janssens, a PhD Researcher at Ghent University. I'm researching data-driven multi-modal Human-Robot Interaction - and try to find how we can use information from multiple modalities to make human-robot conversations more fluent and personalized.

My PhD project is supervised by [Prof. Tony Belpaeme](https://www.tonybelpaeme.me) and [Prof. Thomas Demeester](https://tdmeeste.github.io/), and I work in the [Artifical Intelligence and Robotics](https://airo.ugent.be) research team, part of [IDLab](https://idlab.technology) at [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en).

Before starting my PhD research, I got a Master's degree in Computer Science Engineering from Ghent University, in 2021, with a focus on Artificial Intelligence.
